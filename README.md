## LUNCHRUNNER
By Stephen, Ben, Matt, and Molly

---

Since time untold, human communities have been forged over food. From the Last Supper to your family’s Thanksgiving table, bonds are strengthened by sharing a good meal. So why should your office be any different?

At LunchRunner, we believe that even a quick run down the block can — and should — be a community experience. 

In a long meeting without any snacks? Let your colleagues know - post your cravings to LunchRunner! Need a breath of fresh air? Volunteer to grab an order - and grab something for yourself along the way! 

Everyone in your office can create their own login to view and post to the community board. In forthcoming updates, we hope to incorporate:
- A map of nearby restaurants with ratings and recommendations
- Data about the most popular spots in your office
- Integration with online ordering systems
- A tip system to thank your hardworking coworkers
